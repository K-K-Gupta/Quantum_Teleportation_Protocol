# Project Overview-

Welcome to the Quantum Teleportation project! This project explores the fascinating world of quantum computing, focusing on one of its most intriguing applications: the teleportation of quantum states. By leveraging the power of Qiskit, IBM's open-source quantum computing framework, this project demonstrates the practical implementation of the quantum teleportation protocol.

# Fundamentals of Quantum Computing-
Quantum computing is a revolutionary field that harnesses the principles of quantum mechanics to perform computations in ways that classical computers cannot. At the heart of quantum computing are quantum bits, or qubits, which can exist in superpositions of states, enabling massive parallelism. Entanglement, a unique quantum phenomenon where qubits become interconnected such that the state of one instantly influences the state of another, is a key resource in quantum computing.

# Quantum Entanglement and Teleportation-
Quantum entanglement plays a crucial role in the teleportation of quantum states. Quantum teleportation is a process by which the state of a qubit is transmitted from one location to another, without physically transferring the qubit itself. This is achieved through the entanglement of two qubits and classical communication. The protocol ensures that the quantum state is perfectly reconstructed at the destination, making it an essential technique for quantum communication and quantum networks.

# Implementing Quantum Teleportation with Qiskit-
To translate theoretical knowledge into practical computing, this project uses Qiskit. Qiskit provides a comprehensive set of tools for working with quantum circuits, simulating quantum algorithms, and running them on actual quantum hardware.

# Steps Involved-
Initialization: Set up the quantum and classical registers.
Entanglement Creation: Entangle two qubits using a Hadamard gate and a CNOT gate.
State Preparation: Prepare the quantum state to be teleported.
Bell Measurement: Perform a Bell state measurement on the entangled qubits.
Classical Communication: Use classical bits to transmit the measurement results.
State Reconstruction: Apply conditional quantum gates based on the received classical bits to reconstruct the original state.
